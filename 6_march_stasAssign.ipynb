    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1--> Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is used to describe and summarize data. This type of statistics is used to provide an overview of the main characteristics of a dataset. Some examples of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (e.g. range, variance, standard deviation), and graphs and charts (e.g. histogram, scatter plot). For instance, descriptive statistics might be used to summarize the test scores of a group of students. A teacher might calculate the mean and standard deviation of the test scores to understand the average performance of the students and the degree of variability in their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2--> Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics is used to make inferences and predictions about a larger population based on a sample. This type of statistics is used to test hypotheses, estimate population parameters, and make predictions. Some examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. For instance, inferential statistics might be used to determine if a new drug is effective in treating a disease. Researchers might conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to determine if the observed treatment effects are statistically significant and can be generalized to the larger population of patients with the disease."
